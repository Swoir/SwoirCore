SwoirCore is a Swift package providing the shared core data structures utilised by [Swoir](https://github.com/Swoir/Swoir) and [Swoirenberg](https://github.com/Swoir/Swoirenberg), including the `SwoirBackendProtocol` protocol, the `SwoirBackendError` errors enum, and the `Proof` data type.

The `SwoirBackendProtocol` protocol defines the interface for a proving system backend. Backends conforming to this protocol, like [Swoirenberg](https://github.com/Swoir/Swoirenberg)
, are compatible with [Swoir](https://github.com/Swoir/Swoir) for use as its proving backend.
